# Python-Error-Messages

This project provides enhanced error messages for Python.  It compiles to a JavaScript-library that can readily be
imported in a web page and used together with, e.g. [Skulpt](http://skulpt.org/), 
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) or any other Python-interpreter, really (however, note that its main
support is for Python until 3.6 and selected features from 3.7+ â€“ see below).  The library only checks a Python program 
for syntax errors and is primarily aimed at novice programmers and students.

It has grown out of a [PhD thesis by Tobias Kohn](https://tobiaskohn.ch/index.php/research/research-tigerjython/) and 
is part of the [TigerJython programming envrionment](http://jython.tobiaskohn.ch/).  There is also an 
[online version of TigerJython](https://webtigerjython.ethz.ch/), where this JavaScript-library is currently used.

Let us know if you find the library useful and include it in your own project (jython at tobiaskohn.ch).

In order to make the project a self-contained JavaScript-library, additional resources like translations of the error
messages are directly inlined into the code.


## Usage

### ES Module

To be used in larger projects, the parser can be compiled to a 
[JavaScript ES module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
The file can be found in [release/tigerpython-parser.mjs](release/tigerpython-parser.mjs), along a standalone
JavaScript file (see below).  The accompanying [index.html](release/index.html) demonstrates how the module could
be loaded and used in a simple HTML.  However, make sure your server delivers the module with MIME type
`text/javascript`.

Note: when compiling to an ES module, the tests currently fail.  It seems node.js is complaining about using `export`
instead of `module.export` in the generated module.


### Standalone JavaScript File

In order to use the parser for error checking in your project, load the respective 
[JavaScript-file](release/tigerpython-parser.js), set your preferences in the `TPyParser` object and then check your
code.  You can find a simple example in [doc/index.html](doc/index.html).
```JavaScript
TPyParser.rejectDeadCode = true;
TPyParser.setLanguage("en");
var err = TPyParser.checkSyntax(my_code);
if (err !== null) {
  var error_line = err.line;
  var error_msg = err.msg;
  // Display the error...
}
```


### The TPyParser Object

The `TPyParser` object provides two methods for checking syntax:
- **`TPyParser.checkSyntax(source: string): ErrorInfo`**  Takes the entire source code and returns either `null` or the
  first error found in the Python program.
- **`TPyParser.findAllErrors(source: string): Array[ErrorInfo]`**  Takes the entire source code and returns a list of 
  all errors found in the Python program.
  
A third method returns the AST:
- **`TPyParser.parse(source: string): object`**  Takes the entire source code and returns the AST as (generic) objects.
  Each object has a field `kind` that corresponds to the class in Python.  While the AST is as close to CPython as 
  possible, there are some minor differences, which stem mainly from the fact that the parser supports several different
  versions of Python, or provides slightly more information in some cases.
  Note that this is feature is currently under development and not thoroughly tested, yet.

Available options:
- **`evalMode: boolean`**  Set to `true` when the given code is from an interactive console / shell.  The parser would 
  normally reject simple expressions like `3 + 4` as not having side effects.  However, in the context of a shell, this
  is perfectly legal and normal.
- **`newDivision: boolean`**  (Python 2 only) Python 3 distinguishes between "true" and "integer" division 
  (`/` vs `//`) whereas Python 2 does not (by default).  Set this flag to `true` if you use this "new division" in
  Python 2.
- **`pythonVersion: int`**  An integer value that is either 2 or 3 and indicates the used Python version (default 3).
- **`rejectDeadCode: bool`**  If this flag is set to `true`, dead code will be rejected as erroneous (e.g. code after
  a `return` or `break` statement).
- **`repeatStatement: bool`**  _TigerJython_ allows the use of `repeat` as a keyword for simple loops.  Set this flag
  to `true` to mark `repeat` as a keyword.
- **`sagePower: bool`**  _Sage_ uses the `^` operator as a power operator rather than _xor_ (which becomes `^^`).  Set
  this flag to `true` to mark `^` as power operator and enable `^^` and `^^=` etc. as valid operators.
- **`strictCode: bool`**  If set to `true`, the parser will be very strict and report issues that are usually not
  considered errors in Python, but typical student mistakes.
- **`warningAsErrors: bool`**  If set to `true`, warnings are also reported as errors.
- **`setLanguage(s: string)`**  Change the language for the error message, where the language `s` is a two-letter
  identifier like `"en"`, `"de"`, or `"fr"`.
- **`setErrorMessage(code: string, msg: string)`**  Occasionally, you might want to change just a few of the error
  messages in a given language to adapt it to your system, but you probably do not want to recompile the entire parser
  for that.  In such a case, use `setErrorMessage()` to override the builtin error message and replace it by something
  new.  You can find all available error codes in 
  [errors.ErrorCode.scala](tpParser/shared/src/main/scala/tigerpython/parser/errors/ErrorCode.scala).
  
  Example usage:  
  `setErrorMessage("MISSING_SPACE", "Missing whitespace.")`


## Supported Python Versions

The parser was originally written so support Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.  With Python 3.9, the grammar has significantly
changed (including the AST nodes), as the old LL(1)-parser was replaced by a Pegen-parser.  The structure of this 
parser and the generated AST therefore deviates quite a bit from the ones used in Python 3.9+.  Nonetheless, we try to
support new syntactic elements or changes to the syntax, but cannot guarantee full compatibility.  Concerning newer
features, the current state is as follows:

- Assignment expressions (aka the 'Walrus' operator `:=`) are supported and will generate errors when the assignment
  expression is used as a statement, if the target is anything other than a name or if they are chained;
- f-Strings are partially supported in that the parser will accept f-strings, but not inspect them any further.  That
  is, you can use `f"x = {x}"`, but the parser will not complain about errors such as `f"x = {x"` or `f"x = {x +}"`;
- Positional only-arguments are, likewise, accepted through the slash in the arguments list.  However, this is currently
  not reflected in the AST and no further checks are performed.


## Compilation

The entire project is written in [Scala 2.12](https://scala-lang.org/) / [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) and uses
[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

When `sbt` is installed, go to the project's root directory and use `sbt fastOptJS` or `sbt fullOptJS` to compile the
project (`scala.js` supports two compilation modes: fast compilation during development and optimised compilation for
production code).  The output (JavaScript-files) can then be found in `./tpParser/js/target/scala-2.12/`.

The JS-linker was previsouly configured to output a
[JavaScript ES module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).  The line responsible
for this is in [build.sbt](build.sbt): `scalaJSLinkerConfig ~= { _.withModuleKind(ModuleKind.ESModule) }`.  Remove
the comments on this line in order to get an ES module instead of classic JavaScript file (however, `sbt` currently 
crashes because of an `export` vs. `module.export` error). 


## Contribution

The entire parser was written by [Tobias Kohn](https://tobiaskohn.ch/).  The authors who contributed translations for 
the error messages are noted in the [respective files](tpParser/shared/src/main/scala/tigerpython/parser/errormessages).

Please let us know if you would like to add another language for error messages - we are more than happy to include 
new languages.
